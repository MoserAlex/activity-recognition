LaTeX Template 
==============

This template can be used for both the Bachelor Thesis and
the Master Thesis.

To switch between templates go to the top of main.tex and change the document class options:

* `paper` =  Bachelor thesis 1
* `bachelorthesis` = Bachelor thesis 2
* `masterthesis` = Master thesis

To switch the language of the document go to the top of main.tex and change the document class options: 

* `english` 
* `ngerman`

The document adapts text of the title page, affidavit and references according to the language chosen.


Files to change for your thesis:

* `main.tex`: set up document class and add any packages you may need. The rest should be left untouched.
* `_configuration.tex`: configuration file of the project (author name, advisor name, etc.)
* `abstract.tex`: the English abstract
* `kurzfassung.tex`: the German abstract
* `body.tex`: the main text of the thesis
* `appendix.tex`: the optional appendix
