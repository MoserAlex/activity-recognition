# Activity Recognition based on a Generalized Data Set

# LaTeX
The thesis was writen with LaTeX and all files are collected inside the folder latex.

# Resources
The directory resources contains the online available resources used to write this thesis.

# Prototype
To access the prototype, you first need to install the Scikit-learn framework, which also requires NumPy and SciPy. Once you have installed these packages, you can run this program.

To set this project up, just unpack DataSets.rar inside the directory prototype. Afterwards just run the file converter.py. This will take a while, since the converter is calculating all possible features and writing them into csv files for later use. Afterwards you're ready to start with the preprocessing and feature extraction.

If you want to start with the classification immediately, unpack FeatureSets.rar and you're ready to start testing the activity recognition. Just run the file main.py.

The directories "FeatureSets" and "Reports" will automatically be added, if they don't already exist, as soon as the program needs them.
