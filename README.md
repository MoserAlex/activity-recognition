# Activity Recognition based on a Generalized Data Set

# Setup
To set everything up, just unpack DataSets.rar into the directory "DataSets". Afterwards run the commands in file_converter.py. This will take a while, since the converter is calculating all possible features and writing them into csv files for later use. Afterwards you're ready to start with the classification.

The directories "FeatureSets" and "Reports" will automatically be added, if they don't already exist, as soon as the program needs them.
