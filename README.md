# Activity Recognition based on a Generalized Data Set

# Setup of the Prototype
To access the prototype, you first need to install the Scikit-learn framework, which also requires NumPy and SciPy. Once you have installed these packages, you can run this program.

If you want to start immediately, unpack FeatureSets.rar and you're ready to start testing the activity recognition. Just run the file main.py.

To set this project up, just unpack DataSets.rar into the directory "DataSets". Afterwards just run the file converter.py. This will take a while, since the converter is calculating all possible features and writing them into csv files for later use. Afterwards you're ready to start with the classification.

The directories "FeatureSets" and "Reports" will automatically be added, if they don't already exist, as soon as the program needs them.
