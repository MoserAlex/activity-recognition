# Setup
To set everything up, just unpack DataSets.rar into the directory DataSets. Afterwards run the commands in file_converter.py. This will take a while, since the converter is calculating all possible features and writing them into csv files for later use. The needed directories "FeatureSets" and "Reports" will automatically be added, if they don't already exist, as soon as you need them.
